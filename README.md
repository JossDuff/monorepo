Permissive open source licenses are tools for the corporate subversion of libre software; visible source licenses are an even more malignant scourge. All original works in this project are to be licensed under the most aggressive, virulently-contagious copyleft terms possible. To that end everything is licensed under the [Viral Public License](./licenses/LicenseRef-VPL) coupled with the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](./licenses/AGPL-3.0-only) for use in the event that some unaligned party attempts to weasel their way out of copyleft protections. In short: if you use or modify anything in this project for any reason, your project must be licensed under these same terms.
