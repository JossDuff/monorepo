# Sigil

Sigil is an Ethereum rollup with an exit window. It is the execution environment we personally want. A legitimately fully-trustless L2, from day one. No centralized mechanisms, no security council: a dark shadow at the edge of orthodoxy. The bold push for progress before the maws of a hungry abyss. Sigil will save Ethereum.

The Sigil client, for participating in the rollup, is located in the [`sigil`](./sigil/) folder. That folder also includes useful instructions for building and testing the project.
